INSIGHTS I DERIVED

✔ Insight 1 — Father's Job Distribution

You calculated:

other = 56.54%

services = 27.89%

at_home = 6.47%

teacher = 5.54%

health = 3.54%


➡ Majority of fathers are in “other” and “services” job categories.
➡ Teaching and healthcare jobs form a very small fraction.


✔ Insight 2 — Mother's Job Distribution

You found:

other = 39.75%

services = 20.95%

You found:

mother = 455

father = 153

other = 41


➡ Most students live under mothers’ guardianship.

✔ Insight 4 — Pivot Table: Travel Time vs Study Time by Gender

Your pivot table showed:

sex	studytime 1	2	3	4

F	146	303	110	32
M	206	164	32	25


➡ Females with study time 2 spend the most total travel time.
➡ Males have higher travel time at study time = 1.
